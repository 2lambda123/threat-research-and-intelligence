# 2023-07-08 - RomCom Threat Actor Suspected of Targeting Ukraine's NATO Membership Talks at the NATO Summit

## Summary

On July 4, [the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/author/the-blackberry-research-and-intelligence-team) found two malicious documents submitted from an IP address in Hungary, sent as lures to an organization supporting Ukraine abroad, and a document targeting upcoming [NATO Summit](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/whats-table-nato-vilnius-summit-2023-07-07/) guests who may also be providing support to Ukraine.

Our analysis based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), code similarity, and threat actor network infrastructure leads us to conclude that the threat actor known as [RomCom](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2023/06/romcom-resurfaces-targeting-ukraine) is likely behind this operation.

Based on our internal telemetry, network data analysis, and the full set of cyber weapons we collected, we believe the threat actor behind this campaign ran their first drills on June 22, and also a few days before the command-and-control (C2) mentioned in this report was registered and went live.

Update 7/10/23: Note that BlackBerry shared this intelligence with relevant government agencies several days prior to publishing this blog.
