# Mustang Panda Uses the Russian-Ukrainian War to Attack Europe and Asia Pacific Targets

## Summary

As part of ongoing hunting and continuous monitoring efforts regarding the advanced persistent threat (APT) group [Mustang Panda](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/mustang_panda), the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team recently came across an interesting RAR file titled “Political Guidance for the new EU approach towards Russia.rar”.

This file captured our interest due to the ongoing geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe. An examination of its contents revealed a decoy document matching the naming convention of the RAR, along with additional components that are often seen as part of a [typical PlugX](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/10/mustang-panda-abuses-legitimate-apps-to-target-myanmar-based-victims) infection chain.

By delving into the associated network infrastructure and pivoting off related network artifacts, additional files and infrastructure were uncovered. These conformed to similar Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and appeared to be part of a larger campaign from this same threat actor targeting multiple entities, both Government and Private, in several industries and throughout many countries across the world. In this report, we document what we found.
