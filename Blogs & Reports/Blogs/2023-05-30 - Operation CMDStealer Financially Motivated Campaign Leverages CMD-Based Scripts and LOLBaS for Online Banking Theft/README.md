# 2023-05-30 - Operation CMDStealer Financially Motivated Campaign Leverages CMD-Based Scripts and LOLBaS for Online Banking Theft in Portugal, Peru, and Mexico

## Summary

An unknown financially motivated threat actor, very likely from Brazil, is targeting Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking victims, with the goal of stealing online banking access. The victims are primarily in Portugal, Mexico, and Peru. This threat actor employs tactics such as LOLBaS (Living Off the Land Binaries and Scripts), along with CMD-based scripts to carry out its malicious activities.

The campaign utilizes phishing emails in Portuguese and Spanish, and social engineering tactics to target victims. The emails exploit commonly encountered issues, such as transit infractions and taxes, to create a sense of urgency and legitimacy in their phishing messages. By posing as authoritative entities or government agencies, the messages are intended to deceive unsuspecting individuals and get them to disclose their online banking credentials.
