# Black Hat Look-Back: Linux Implants – A Silent, Long-Living Threat

## Summary

As implants on Linux® systems continue to gain prevalence and create blind spots in organizations’ security posture, the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team continues to advise practitioners on how to best fortify their Linux defenses. In fact, I recently returned from Black Hat 2022 in Las Vegas, where my team members and I spent time doing [just that](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/08/linux-threats-a-black-hat-2022-hot-topic).

In the Linux world, as in the rest of IT, the [most basic set of rules](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicSecurity) is proving no longer sufficient to protect ourselves from today’s threat actors. But there is still much that we can do if, like our adversaries, we are willing to learn and adapt.

By studying three prevalent malware families — [Symbiote](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/06/symbiote-a-new-nearly-impossible-to-detect-linux-threat), Orbit, and Red Alert Ransomware — BlackBerry threat researchers have developed a map of shared tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are common among these families, and which are represented in the [MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/).
