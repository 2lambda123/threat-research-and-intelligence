# Drawing a Dragon: Connecting the Dots to Find APT41

## Sumary

The [BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/category/research-and-intelligence) recently connected seemingly disparate malware campaigns, which began with an unusual Cobalt Strike configuration that was first included in a [blog post](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits.html) published the same month as COVID-19 lockdowns began in Europe and the U.S. What we found led us through a malicious infrastructure that had been partially documented in articles by several other research organizations.

The image we uncovered was that of a state-sponsored campaign that plays on people’s hopes for a swift end to the pandemic as a lure to entrap its victims. And once on a user’s machine, the threat blends into the digital woodwork by using its own customized profile to hide its network traffic.
