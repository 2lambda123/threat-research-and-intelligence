# Uncovering the Tactics of RomCom RAT in the Ukraine-Russia Conflict

The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has included a significant cyber dimension.Russia has a rich history of using cyber as part of its military doctrine. In this talk we dive into the history of how Russia developed its Cyber Playboo using Ukraine and Georgia as a testbed to develop their offensive cyber operations (OCOs). We take a look at how Russia has used Cyber to achieve it's strategic goal of protecting or enhancing it’s power and influence.

We examine the initial links between RomCom RAT and Cuba ransomware and also discuss the sudden shift in target by the threat actor utilising RomCom RAT to targeting the Ukrainian Military. In the context of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we observed an interesting trend, a blurring of the lines between cybercrime and “state-sponsored” groups: a crossover between cybercrime groups and state-sponsored groups, specifically in their targeting of Ukrainian entities. Is this potentially a directive from Russian intelligence services? Or is it just patriotic Russian hackers? The talk emphasizes how history can often repeat itself and how it plays a major role in intelligence.
